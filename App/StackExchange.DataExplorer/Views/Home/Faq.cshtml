    <h3>What is this site?</h3>
    <p>
        Stack Exchange Data Explorer allows you to run arbitrary SQL queries on the Stack
        Exchange family of sites, share those queries with your friends and explore interesting
        queries.
    </p>
    <h3>Sounds interesting can you share some technical details?</h3>
    <p>
        Stack Exchange Data Explorer is hosted on SQL Server 2008 R2, the connections to
        the DB are readonly, you may not alter any tables.
    </p>
    <p>
        The controls used are jQuery based, the grid is SlickGrid. All query results are
        cached, so sharing a link to a query will not result in the server going in to a
        tailspin. The query edit control is a slightly modified CodeMirror control, it gives
        up nice syntax highlighting for queries.
    </p>
    <h3>Sounds good, where is the source code?</h3>
    <p>
        Stack Exchange Data Explorer is <b>Open Source</b>. If you would like to help us
        make it more awesome, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/stack-exchange-data-explorer/">
            check out the code</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Do you support parameterized queries?</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Yes</strong> to get it to work name your parameters like ##this##.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is also built in support for strongly typed parameters of type <strong>string</strong>,
        <strong>int</strong> and <strong>float</strong>. If you name your parameter ##bob:string##
        it will be treated as a string, this will result in both quoting and escaping of
        single quotes.
    </p>
    <h3>
        How do I name and describe my queries?</h3>
    <p>
        A query can have a name and description, to name it lead with a comment, to describe
        it continue commenting, for example:
        <pre>
-- This is my query name 
-- This is my description
-- I can span multiple lines
SELECT 1

</pre>
    </p>
    <h3>
        What is the point of logging on?</h3>
    <p>
        Anonymous users can initially name a query, but can not change the names of any
        existing queries. Additional features for logged on users:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We will keep track of all the queries you execute</li>
        <li>We will automatically populate any parameter named ##UserId## with your user id
            on the respective sites (if your EmailHash matches)</li>
        <li>We will allow you to save queries so you can get back to them later</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        What is the deal with magic columns?</h3>
    <p>
        If you alias an id column with as [Post Link] it will automatically create a link
        in the result set to the parent site. Similarly if you alias an id column with as
        [User Link] it will display a link to the user page. select top 10 * from Posts
        will show you how tags are done. (Magic columns for images is planned) example:
        <a href="/stackoverflow/s/87/most-controversial-posts-on-the-site">most controversial
            posts</a>
    </p>
    <h3>
        What is the deal with featured queries?</h3>
    <p>
        At the moment, admins have permission to feature interesting queries on <a href="/stackoverflow/queries">
            this page</a>, we are looking for better ways to manage the huge query list
        that is building up.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why are my queries not showing up in the recent query list?</h3>
    <p>
        The recent, featured and popular query lists only show saved queries. If you have
        a query you would like to share with the community be sure to save it.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Do you offer Open Data protocol endpoints to the Stack Exchange sites?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Yes, there are links to the <a href="http://www.odata.org/">OData</a> endpoints
        as soon as you click through on the site.
    </p>
    <h3>
        How frequently is Stack Exchange Data Explorer updated?</h3>
    <p>
        Data is updated monthly.</p>
    <h3>
        Which sites are included?</h3>
    <p>
        All public Stack Exchange websites are included. Sites that are in public or private
        beta are excluded.</p>
    <h3>
        Our site has just exited the public beta stage, when will it be included?</h3>
    <p>
        On our monthly update cycle we add any new sites that have launched.</p>
